Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.
Steps:
1.	Understand the Problem:
o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a new project for the inventory management system.
3.	Implementation:
o	Define a class Product with attributes like productId, productName, quantity, and price.
o	Choose an appropriate data structure to store the products (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
o	Implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory.
4.	Analysis:
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
o	Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function
Scenario: 
You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.
Steps:
1.	Understand Asymptotic Notation:
o	Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
o	Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Product with attributes for searching, such as productId, productName, and category.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement linear search and binary search algorithms.
o	Store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.
4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders
Scenario: 
You are tasked with sorting customer orders by their total price on an e-commerce platform. This helps in prioritizing high-value orders.
Steps:
1.	Understand Sorting Algorithms:
o	Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Order with attributes like orderId, customerName, and totalPrice.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement Bubble Sort to sort orders by totalPrice.
o	Implement Quick Sort to sort orders by totalPrice.
4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.
o	Discuss why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort.

Exercise 4: Employee Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.
Steps:
1.	Understand Array Representation:
o	Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Employee with attributes like employeeId, name, position, and salary.
3.	Implementation:
o	Use an array to store employee records.
o	Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete employees in the array.
4.	Analysis:
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
o	Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.

Exercise 5: Task Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a task management system where tasks need to be added, deleted, and traversed efficiently.
Steps:
1.	Understand Linked Lists:
o	Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Task with attributes like taskId, taskName, and status.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement a singly linked list to manage tasks.
o	Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete tasks in the linked list.
4.	Analysis:
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
o	Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

Exercise 6: Library Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.
Steps:
1.	Understand Search Algorithms:
o	Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement linear search to find books by title.
o	Implement binary search to find books by title (assuming the list is sorted).
4.	Analysis:
o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
o	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
Scenario: 
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.
Steps:
1.	Understand Recursive Algorithms:
o	Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
2.	Setup:
o	Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.
3.	Implementation:
o	Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.
4.	Analysis:
o	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
